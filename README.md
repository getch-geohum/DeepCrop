# DeepCrop
This repository is mainly dedicated for the integration of multi-source multitemporal earth observation data for crop type mapping using machine and deep learning models designed to handle time series data. The experiment is done in data scarce smallholder farming areas. In addition to mapping crop types, the scripts are used for crop yield modeling from time series vegetation indices. 

Data access, preprocessing, sample preparation and visualization scripts are included inside notebooks folder


this repository also uses core implementations from [Ru√üwurm et al (2020)]( https://github.com/dl4sits/breizhcrops).
