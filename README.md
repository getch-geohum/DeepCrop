# DeepCrop
This repository is mainly dedicated for integration of multi-source multitemporal earth observation data for crop type mapping using machine and deep learning models designed to handle time series data. The experiemnt is done in datascarce smallolder farming areas. In addition to mapping crop types, the scripts are used for crop yiled modeling from time series vegetation indices. It also includes preprocessing and visualization as jupyter notebook file.
